# ARM Assembly Lexxer

Primarily a proof of concept, as the automatic analysis tool quickly became far out of scope of the thesis.

To see the lexxer working, run `$> zig run lexxer.zig` with the desired assembly file path hard coded in the file. `$> zig build` and `main.zig` are artifacts from when goals were different.
