# Static-Energy-Analyzer
Senior Independent Study thesis project. Performed semi-automatic static analysis of ARM assembly to infer upper bound energy cost.

Completed in partial fulfillment of graduation requirements at the College of Wooster Independent Study Program.

## Overview

The project is broken into various subfolders, as the research involved multiple steps that were separated through manual work. Each subfolder has a relevant README, if necessary.

`/asmlexxer` is an assembly text file parser, with additional code left in progress, where additional parts of an automatic SEA would be slotted in if completed.

`/hardwaretest` contains helper scripts and sets of highly unrolled written assembly files

`/testprograms` is for simple programs and their corresponding assembly, for testing the asmlexxer on and for hypothetical energy analysis

`/pubs_solver` is largely unaltered code shared by Dr. Samir Genaim, an author on PUBS-related publications.
